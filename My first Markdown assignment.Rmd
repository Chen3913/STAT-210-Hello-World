Write three paragraphs with headings
Write a brief paragraph about three interesting things you learned that you could do in R Markdown. Each paragraph should have a header (size 4) with a link to the lesson on the R Markdown page from your Intro to R Markdown module followed by a description of what it can do and how it is practical or useful to you personally.

#R Markdown is useful because it can hold tons of data

     I feel like R markdown is like a word document like Microsoft Office. It's the same feeling like working on your first computer. Sometimes, it takes time to master a program and some usually comes naturally like videogames. R markdown is useful because it can store data in my computer
     
##R Markdown can be used for tables
    R Markdown is useful because I can sort all types of data. For example, I can record the amount of mililiters that I can drink water instead of drinking Coca-cola soda and compare that to each other. Having that set of observation can motivate myself to being more healthier in drinking water instead. 
    
###R Markdown can be used for evidence
Instead of using Excel from Microsoft Office, I like to have this set of skill where I keep all my information and have people look at them. There was a recent study that most of scientific papers use Excel but some of those papers have errors due to the program. I can use R markdown to take care of the evidence and prove to myself that I am capable of programming data.
